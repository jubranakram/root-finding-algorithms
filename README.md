# root-finding-algorithms
Root finding algorithms for nonlinear equations using Python

## Overview

This repository provides Python implementations of root-finding algorithms for solving nonlinear equations. The code is organized into two main files:

- **main.py**: Contains the primary logic for executing root-finding algorithms.
- **utils.py**: Includes utility functions to support the main algorithms.

## Features

- Implementation of popular root-finding methods (e.g., Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant).
- Modular code structure for easy extension.
- Utility functions for equation handling and result formatting.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jubranakram/root-finding-algorithms.git
    cd root-finding-algorithms
    ```

2. **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## File Structure

```
root-finding-algorithms/
├── main.py      # Main algorithms and execution
├── utils.py     # Helper functions
└── README.md    # Project documentation
```

## Usage

Modify `main.py` to specify your nonlinear equation and choose the desired algorithm. Utility functions in `utils.py` can be used for equation parsing and result display.
